# WP-Theme-Blank

<p>
	A Wordpress Blank Theme built on HTML5, barebone in nature. Nearly empty, with the exception of some bundled packages.</br>
	This theme is built for easy integration with nearly anything compatible with a Wordpress installation.</br>
	For development from almost absolute scratch, and the basis for my projects when I don't know what I'm going to create.
